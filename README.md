Bitcoin Mining Control Authority

# What is Bithority?

Bithority or Bitcoin mining control authority is a protocol/network based on the Stacks blockchain that provides a trustless platform for renting Bitcoin hashrate to any-scale investors! The Bithority project aims to vastly decentralize the Bitcoin mining ecosystem.

## Problem Definition

The Bitcoin mining ecosystem is becoming bigger and bigger by the day and those who have access to special industrial facilities, suitable for mining, are increasingly attracted to establish mining farms and participate in securing the Bitcoin network. 

Building a mining farm currently takes a considerable amount of capital and financial capacity and requires capable miners to deal with challenging technical issues such as supplying cheap energy sources, efficient mining machines, electrical infrastructures, cooling systems, adapting to regional jurisdictions, risk control strategies, cash flow control and professional budgeting plans. Therefore, we see a totally different shape of mining in line with the early days of Bitcoin when Bitcoin was still minted profitably with home-scale systems and a low budget!

As such, concerns have ben raised and arguments around centralization of Bitcoin mining... mining in the hands of only those very rich individuals/corporations that have special facilities. We seriously think this is a true concern and needs to be addressed by dedicated Bitcoin community players in order to protect and keep the decentralized essence of Bitcoin network the way it was envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto, set out in it's whitepaper!

In this regard, the Bithority idea was emerged to topple this very concern.

## Bithority Solution

Bithority uses smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain to raise funds for mining operations from investors. New miners can raise capital for buying ASICs and developing their operation, while investors get a share of the hash power that the miners create.
Therefore, Bithority practically act as a Bitcoin hashrate rental service that benefits both miners and investors by sharing in the Bitcoin mining economy and and a share of its profitability cake!

As such, any miner around the world, no matter where, that has enough facilities to plug in a mining farm can then connect it to Bithority protocol and rent his hashrate. No need of any reputation or credential, KYC, bureacracy, jurisdictional compliance and no need of nothing except pluging his farm into Bithority! 
On the other side, any-scale investors (from very small to very big ones), can join the Bithority platform to select their favorite miner and appropriate hashrate to invest their preferred amount to participate in Bitcoin mining anywhere in the world!
