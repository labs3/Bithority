Bitcoin Mining Control Authority

# What is Bithority?

Bithority or Bitcoin mining control authority is a protocol/network based on the Stacks blockchain that provides a trustless platform for renting Bitcoin hashrate to any-scale investors! The Bithority project aims to vastly decentralize Bitcoin mining ecosystem among all Bitcoin communities around the world.

## Problem Definition

The Bitcoin mining ecosystem is becoming more and more larger day by day and those who access to special industrial facilities, suitable for mining, are increasingly attracted to establish mining farms and participate in securing the Bitcoin network. 

Building a mining farm currently takes considerable amount of investment and financial capacity and needs capable miners to deal with challenging technical issues such as supplying cheap energy sources, efficient mining machines, electrical infrastructures, cooling systems, adapting to regional jurisdictions, risk control strategies, cash flow control and professional budgeting plans. Therefore, we see a totally different shape of mining comparing to beginning days of Bitcoin when you could only mine by small home-scale systems and still take a noticeable profit!

As such, there have been raised many concerns and arguments around centralization of Bitcoin mining in hands of only those very rich individuals/corporations that have special facilities. We seriously think this is a true concern and needs to be addressed by dedicated Bitcoin community players in order to protect and keep the decentralized essence of Bitcoin network as what Satoshi Nakamoto planed in his Bitcoin whitepaper!

In this regard, Bithority idea was created to try solving this very concern.

## Bithority Solution

Bithority uses smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain to raise funds for mining operations from investors. New miners can raise capital for buying ASICs and their operation, while investors get a share of the hash power that the miners create.
