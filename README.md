Bitcoin Mining Control Authority

# What is Bithority?

Bithority or Bitcoin mining control authority is a protocol/network based on the Stacks blockchain that provides a trustless platform for renting Bitcoin hashrate to any-scale investors! The Bithority project aims to vastly decentralize Bitcoin mining ecosystem among all Bitcoin communities around the world.

## Problem Definition

The Bitcoin mining ecosystem is becoming more and more larger day by day and those who access to special industrial facilities, suitable for mining, are increasingly attracted to establish mining farms and participate in securing the Bitcoin network. 

Building a mining farm currently takes considerable amount of investment and financial capacity and needs capable miners to deal with challenging technical issues such as supplying cheap energy sources, efficient mining machines, electrical infrastructures, cooling systems, adapting to regional jurisdictions, risk control strategies, cash flow control and professional budgeting plans. Therefore, we see a totally different shape of mining comparing to beginning days of Bitcoin when you could only mine by small home-scale systems and still take a noticeable profit!

As such, there have been raised many concerns and arguments around centralization of Bitcoin mining in hands of only those very rich individuals/corporations that have special facilities. We seriously think this is a true concern and needs to be addressed by dedicated Bitcoin community players in order to protect and keep the decentralized essence of Bitcoin network as what Satoshi Nakamoto planed in his Bitcoin whitepaper!

In this regard, Bithority idea was created to try solving this very concern.

## Bithority Solution

Bithority uses smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain to raise funds for mining operations from investors. New miners can raise capital for buying ASICs and developing their operation, while investors get a share of the hash power that the miners create.
Therefore, Bithority practically act as a Bitcoin hashrate rental service that benefits both miners and investors by sharing Bitcoin mining economy and some piece of its profitability cake!

As such, any miner around the world, no matter where, that has enough facilities to plug in a mining farm can then connect it to Bithority protocol and rent his hashrate. No need of any reputation or credential, KYC, bureacracy, jurisdictional compliance and no need of nothing except pluging his farm into Bithority! 
On the other side, any-scale invetsors, from very small to big ones, can join the Bithority platform to select their favorite miner and hashrate to invest their favorite amount to participate in Bitcoin mining from all over the world!
